# docker-workshop

docker + dc/os workshop initially created for JavaZone 2016 Oslo

## Getting Started

You will need to install:

* Docker (for your [platform](https://docs.docker.com/installation/))
* Setup a DC/OS cluster:
	* [https://dcos.io/](https://dcos.io/)
	* [dcos-vagrant](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant)
	* [Mini-Mesos](https://minimesos.org/)

For these provided labs, Apache Mesos + Marathon is all that is needed for the cluster.
