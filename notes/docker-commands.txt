	docker run → cannot be detached with ^P^Q; can SIGKILL client; can reattach with docker attach

last docker
	docker ps -l -q

kill all running
	docker kill $(docker ps -q)
	
remove all stopped containers
	docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
# get ip
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | grep IPA
